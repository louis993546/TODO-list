# TODO list

> Because there is not enough TODO list Android app already ü§∑‚Äç

## Goal

I would like to make a TODO list app, focus on organizing my stand-up meetings, so that I know what
to say, and during the day I can actually look back to the list, and do the things that I said I'm
planning to do

### Feature-wise

#### Minimal Viable Product

- Local only
- Reasonable design

#### "This is something that is actually usable"

- Import/Export data
- Proper CI/CD

### Tech-wise

- Pure Java (just for my own education)
- UI test w/ Espresso
- Unit test w/ JUnit4

## Non-goal (for now)

- Integrate with any cloud storage (other than the built-in Android backup mechanism)
